      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Maciej Pyra - Data Scientist and Python Developer who is passionate for exploring relationships between variables and recognition of hidden data patterns. My interest in cutting edge tools and technologies allows me to combine my career path with my hobbies.
I really enjoy programming in Python the most - this language together with SQL (databases integration) was and is still used most often in my business projects, but I am open to other programming languages, predominantly R and Julia.</description>
